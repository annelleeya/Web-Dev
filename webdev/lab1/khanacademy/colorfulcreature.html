        <p>The <em>parrots</em> are awesome because along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpiesâ€”are among <strong>the most intelligent birds</strong>, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length; many are vividly coloured and some, multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum..</p>
